#You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence. Your task is to find the missing integer.

    # Sum of first n natural numbers
    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  

    # Sum of given array
    actual_sum = sum(arr)

    return expected_sum - actual_sum
