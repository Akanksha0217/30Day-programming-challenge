#You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence. Your task is to find the missing integer.


arr = [1, 2, 3]

def missing(a):
    n = len(a) + 1   # since one number is missing
    total = n * (n + 1) // 2
    return total - sum(a)

print("Missing number:", missing(arr))
